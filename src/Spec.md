# Enhanced Todo Application Specification

## Overview
A modern Todo application with user authentication, personal todo lists, and a responsive interface built with React, TypeScript, and React Router.

## Features

### 1. Authentication
- User registration with email and password
- User login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Persistent session management

### 2. User Management
- User profile page
- Ability to update profile information
- Email verification
- Account deletion option

### 3. Todo Management
- Create, read, update, and delete todos
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Organize todos by categories/tags
- Search and filter todos
- Sort todos by different criteria (date, status)
- Add due dates to todos

### 4. Data Structure

#### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Todo
```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  task: string;
  completed: boolean;
  category?: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Routes
- `/` - Landing page (public)
- `/login` - Login page
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/forgot-password` - Password reset
- `/dashboard` - User's main todo dashboard (protected)
- `/profile` - User profile management (protected)
- `/todos/:categoryId` - Category-specific todos (protected)
- `/settings` - User settings (protected)

### Technology Stack
- React + TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Firebase Authentication (recommended)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Context API for state management

### Security Considerations
- JWT token-based authentication
- Protected API routes
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Secure password storage (hashing)

## UI/UX Requirements
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling and user feedback
- Intuitive navigation
- Dark/Light mode support
- Accessible design (WCAG compliance)

## Future Enhancements (v2)
- Collaborative todos (shared lists)
- Todo attachments
- Push notifications
- Calendar integration
- Export/Import functionality
- Activity log/history

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Authentication
1. Project setup with TypeScript and React
2. Authentication implementation
3. Protected routing setup

### Phase 2: Core Todo Functionality
1. Basic CRUD operations for todos
2. Todo list UI components
3. Category management

### Phase 3: User Features
